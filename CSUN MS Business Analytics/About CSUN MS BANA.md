Classes include:

| **Semester**  | **Class Name** | **Description** |**Grade**|
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Fall 2023  | BANA 610 - Visualization & Communication for Business | This course helps students link the various facets of business and provides them with an intuitive way to better understand data. Data visualization consists of tools and techniques to generate insights from data and convey them to others. Furthermore, it presents an overview of more advanced charts, tables, and data dashboards. Students learn how to work with state-of-the-art visualization computer software packages such as Python and Tableau.  | A |
| Fall 2023  | BANA 614 - Database Management | The primary goal of this course is to understand principles and practices of database management and design. Database administration (including security, concurrency control, performance monitoring and tuning, resource sharing, and recovery) is also covered. Students learn and practice the fundamentals of SQL, entity-relationship diagrams, dependencies and normalization. Projects require students to design and develop a database application for a business situation by utilizing design tools and a major database management systems (DBMS) package. | A |
| Spring 2024  | BANA 620 - Predictive Analytics | This course provides a comprehensive coverage of the most widely used classical and modern predictive business modeling techniques, such as logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, na√Øve bayes, clustering, neural network, regularization, etc. This course also provides a strong theoretical foundation of predictive analytics in making both classifications and predictions based on big data. Using realistic business examples, students learn how to implement the solutions using state of the art business analytics software. | B |
| Spring 2024  | BANA 622 - Programming for Business Analytics |This course focuses on the state-of-the-art data science programming languages. Students learn to build algorithms and apply programming languages to discover patterns hidden in datasets. The course enables students to use interdisciplinary machine learning techniques to create algorithms, which can efficiently manage large volumes of data to quickly make real time decisions. It also covers a broad cross-section of programming techniques and prepares students in the application of machine learning techniques. This course emphasizes on building tools using programming languages.  | B |
| Spring 2024  | MKT 656 - Marketing Analytics | This course focuses on using a systematic and analytical approach to marketing decision-making. Most of the frameworks, processes, and analyses developed by marketing researchers, consultants, and managers focus on the four "first principles" of marketing: all customers differ; all customers change; all competitors react; and all resources are limited. This course involves analyzing data, and interpreting and communicating results to guide marketing decisions based on these first principles. It covers concepts, methods, and applications of decision modeling to address marketing issues such as segmentation, targeting, product positioning, promotion, pricing, and channel decisions. | A |
| Fall 2024  | BANA 630 - Prescriptive Analytics |This course aims to enhance students' ability to make actionable data-driven decisions using optimization modeling techniques to achieve business goals. It will train students how to transform data into action using modeling with logical thinking and ultimately help them develop critical thinking in decision makings. Students will learn how to ask the right questions, define business objectives, understand and capture constraints, and optimize for success of their business. The emphasis will be on the formulation of different optimization problems and the use of the appropriate quantitative techniques, including heuristics and optimization. The course will also examine a variety of practical business analytics applications, including financial planning, human resources, marketing strategies, logistics, production planning, inventory management, and revenue maximization.  | A |
| Fall 2024  | BANA 640 - Supply Chain Analytics | This course explores predictive and prescriptive modeling and analytical tools for design, analysis, execution and integration of supply chains.  Students will learn how to formulate and solve supply chain problems using business analytics techniques. The emphasis will be on how these models can be used in fundamental supply chain applications, such as transportation, forecasting, capacity allocation, production planning, sales and operations planning, facility location and distribution network design. This course also provides an example-driven approach to learn about important supply chain models, problems, and solution methodologies.  This course is designed to help students master the analytical tools and techniques that they can appreciate and use effectively, as well as reinforce their understanding of supply chain theories, principles, and concepts studied previously in foundation courses. | A |
| Fall 2024  | BANA 650 - Healthcare Analytics | This course prepares students to understand the process of analyzing electronic health records (EHRs) to improve patient care and to achieve greater efficiencies in healthcare systems. The course enables students to understand the characteristics of the clinical data to derive data-driven solutions. The course covers handling of real-world EHRs, cleansing data, imputing data, and using existing methods to solve major clinical problems, such as readmission, mortality prediction, etc. The key focus is on the interpretation and presentation of the results to practitioners or physicians. The course covers both clinical and administrative aspects of healthcare. | A |
| Spring 2025  | BANA 698 - Culminating Project | This is a culminating graduate project in which small teams of graduate business analytics students demonstrate mastery of the program learning goals through a project in business analytics. Under faculty supervision, graduate business analytics students collaborate with a business partner, including a potential client, faculty advisor, program director, and/or subject matter expert, to determine the scope of work to address a business problem related to a business analytics. Students systematically analyze the business problem by collecting and analyzing business data, using the tools and techniques learned in the graduate business analytics program. They apply research to make evidence-based and well-informed decisions and provide business recommendations to effectively address the problem. They will develop and submit a written report with business recommendations |  |
